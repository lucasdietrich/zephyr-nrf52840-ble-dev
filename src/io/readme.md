3 LEDs:
- BLE led (blue) : pulse when receiving advertising packets, brightness indicates strength of signal (RSSI)
- IPC led :
  - RX (orange) : pulse when receiving an IPC packet, pulse length indicates received packet length

Use 10kHz PWM to control brightness

Use a hardware timer or RTC to stop pulses (via counter driver)
